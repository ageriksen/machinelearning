//Define Model & Architecture\\
-setup activation z_i^l
-define number of layers and activation function number of nodes
-input and output layer
softmax in our case
-Define cost func+optimiser
-MSE for regression
-gross-entropy for classification
-Gradient descent(stochastic gradient descent)
-differentiate cost func with regards to weights
    - and bias
    - for same layer and node
-find weight and bias --> optimize
-you can then go forward and backward untill the cost func reaches a minimum.

accuracy function

- one-hot vector

BREAK

Accuracy function
- article Meta et al
    -   examples of regression etc. 
    -   has jupyter notebooks
    -   whole point is insight. 

UCI website has loads of sets. 
easy model - spin <- interesting data set. 
also "kaggle.com"

def accurascy_score(Y_test, Y_pred):
    return np.sum( Y_test == Y_pred )/len(Y_test)

visualization with python thinf "seaborn" <- very typical for showing optimizations ALSO PROJECT 1
        creates heatmaps.
