# Recap SVM

mean deadpoint between classes. using a vector from midpoint of dead land 
in between. 
define a 
    f(x) = x^Tw + b = 0

and include a slack variable - new lagrangian multiplier to the problem

cases where SVM would not work, e.g. cases where "Kernel Classification" would be better suited

The classes can often be remapped so that the SVM can be used. then you need to massage your data. 

At the end of the day, find a constraint, set up Lagrangian multipliers and find the lagrangian
