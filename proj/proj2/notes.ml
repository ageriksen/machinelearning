-   default regression irt. problems project 1
    -   opportunity to fix issues and improve
    -   opportunity to change scope
    : The codes need to be rerun in any case, in order to compare. 


## Checkups
-   onehotencoder and one hot in general
-   read up on columnTransformer


## thoughts
-   if similar or same method of extracting data, perhaps save to a binary file
    for easier extraction


## scientific article
-   what is a lift chart?

## task b, define cost function and design matrix
- might as well start with the code example providing an extraction of
    the data into an output matrix and design matrix. Though, as we found 
    with the help of the LA during tuesdays session, the one hot encoding
    and normalization was a bit messed up. 
- the cost function in the slides is defined for single classifier. 
    I'm uncertain regarding the transformation of this and the underlying 
    reasons for setting it up. This is probably in large part from the stress
    surrounding it, and me overcomplicating...
